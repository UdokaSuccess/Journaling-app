## **Thanks for hopping by.** 
This is a personal project developed because of the need to organize things at a point my life. I wanted something simple yet efficient, aesthetic and focused only on my notes...
Nothing really extra that will distract me on the screen. Scroll to the end for screenshots.

This project was built using:
- React.js for structure
- Modern CSS for styling including variables, etc
- Workbox for service worker; making it a progressive web app (PWA)

The notes are arranged in the categories, so the state is managed by category. This ensures the code is kept simple (KISS- Keep it Simple Stupid).
This web app  is completely responsive, installable, and works offline therefore you can download on your mobile phone or any device. You can read my article on how to build a PWA to replicate it on your projects;
[A comprehensive guide to Progressive Web Apps](https://dev.to/udoka033/progressive-web-apps-pwa-a-comprehensive-guide-57ii).
Performance optimisation was a priority in this project, and measures were taken to achieve that. Take a look at the lighthouse report with a live demo.
